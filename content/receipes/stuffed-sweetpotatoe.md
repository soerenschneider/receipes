# Ingredients
- 3 Tbsp of olive oil
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1 Tbsp of ginger
- 15g dried tomatoes
- 1 lemon
- 1 ts of chilli flakes
- 200g chickpeas (already cooked)
- 200g fresh baby spinach
- 210ml coconut milk
- 1 ts of salt
- 2 sweet potatoes

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 175°C
1. Rub sweet potatoes with 2 Tbsp of olive oil and loosely wrap each one in a piece of aluminum foil.
1. Pierce each sweet potato several times with a fork, place on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 45 minutes. Then let cool down briefly.
1. Meanwhile, peel the ginger, onion and garlic. Finely chop the ginger and garlic, cut the onion into cubes. Rasp off the lemon peel with a zester grater and extract the juice from the lemon. Roughly chop the sun-dried tomatoes and wash the baby spinach.
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan and sauté the onions for 5 minutes until they begin to turn brown. Then add garlic, ginger, dried tomatoes, lemon zest and chilli flakes and fry for 3 minutes while stirring.
1. Drain the chickpeas in a colander and place in the saucepan. Fry for 7 minutes until they begin to turn golden brown and are completely covered in the spices.
1. Add the spinach to the chickpeas and cook while stirring and let them collapse. Then add the coconut milk, salt and 2 Tbsp of lemon juice. Bring to the boil briefly, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
1. Cut the sweet potatoes lengthways up to halfway and fill with the chickpea and spinach mixture.
