# Ingredients
- 4 fresh eggs
- Savoiardi biscuits 300g ("ladyfingers")
- Mascarpone 500g
- Sugar 75g
- Cacao powder
- Coffee

# Instructions
1. Separate yolks from egg whites in two different bowls (medium size)
1. Add half of the sugar to the yolks and whip them until they become like a cream, then add the mascarpone
1. Now whip the egg whites - pouring the remaining sugar a little at a time - until stiff
1. Add them to the yolks cream, stirring slowly without changing direction
1. Prepare a coffee pot (two medium mokas are enough), spread a little cream in a baking tray and start placing the biscuits soaked in coffee (tip: do not soak them too much - they shouldn’t melt). After completing the first layer spread more cream (the more the tastier but the depends on your taste :) ). Proceed with the second layer of biscuits soaked in coffee. Spread the remaining cream and “sprinkle” above the cacao powder until covering it. 
1. Let it rest in the fridge for a while
