# Ingredients

Serves 4 people

- 20g dried porcini mushrooms
- 150g mushrooms
- 200g oyster mushrooms
- 1 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 300g rice
- 120ml white wine
- 1.2l vegetable stock
- 2 spoons of butter
- 100g parmesan
- Salt pepper

# Instructions

1. Soak the porcini mushrooms in 200 ml of warm water for about 30 minutes. Put the boletus on a sieve, don't throw away the water.
1. Peel the garlic and onion. Cut the latter into fine cubes. Chop the garlic. Simmer the vegetable stock in a saucepan and keep warm. Grate the parmesan.
1. Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a second saucepan and saut√© the onion cubes together with the garlic for 2 minutes until translucent.
1. Add the rice and fry for 3 minutes. Then deglaze with white wine and simmer over low heat, stirring regularly, until the rice has absorbed the liquid.
1. Then repeat the process with the hot broth, but only add enough vegetable broth to the rice that it is just covered with liquid. So gradually add the broth to the rice.
1. Clean the mushrooms, wash and pat dry. Halve the mushrooms, quarter the oyster mushrooms. Wash, clean and halve tomatoes. Heat the oil in a pan, fry the mushrooms in it.
1. After about 12 minutes, test how soft the rice is already cooked. The risotto is ready when it has a thick consistency and the rice is al dente. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Finally stir in the remaining Tbsp of butter and parmesan into the risotto and serve immediately.
