# Ingredients
* 1kg flour type 405
* 1/4-1/3 cube of yeast 
* 40g salt
* 625ml water

# Instructions
1. Add approximately 600g of the flour, the water and the yeast to a big bowl
1. Stir the content until a consistency is formed that reminds you of pancake dough
1. Leave it for 20 minutes. This step is important
1. Stir/knead for 4 to 5 minutes
1. Add the rest of the flour to the bowl, knead for another 2 to 3 minutes
1. Leave for another 20 minutes again
1. Remove the dough from the bowl, put it onto flour covered surface to form a big ball
1. Cut the ball to about 6 to 7 equally sized pieces. Make sure that each ball is not sticky on its surface, roll them in the flour. 
1. Package the balls individually, either freeze them for later consumption or put in the fridge. The dough should rest for about 24 hours before consumption.
