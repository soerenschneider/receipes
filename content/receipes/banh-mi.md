# Ingredients:

## For the tofu
- 500 gr tofu
- 2 EL lemongrass, minced
- 1-2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 ts salt
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- pepper
- 1 chili, minced
- 4 Tbsp vegetable oil

## The bread
- baguette
- [do chua](/receipes/do-chua)
- mayonnaise
- coriander
- cucumber

# Instructions:
1. Cut tofu in 1cm wide slices
1. Mix lemon grass, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, chili and oil
1. Dry the tofu using a towel
1. Rub in both sides of the tofu and let it rest for 15m. Don't use all of the paste as we need it later on for the mayonnaise
1. Heat up a pan and fry tofu for 2-3m from both sides so they're golden while the center remains soft
1. Mix the remaining paste with the mayonnaise
1. Add all the stuff to your baguette - et voila!
